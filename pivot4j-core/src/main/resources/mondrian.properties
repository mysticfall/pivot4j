##Caching Parameters
#Controls whether to use a cache for the results of frequently evaluated expressions.
mondrian.expCache.enable=true
#Determines whether to cache RolapCubeMember objects, each of which associates a member of a shared hierarchy with a particular cube in which it is being used.
mondrian.rolap.EnableRolapCubeMemberCache=false
#Whether to clear a RolapStar's data cache after each query.
mondrian.rolap.star.disableCaching=true
mondrian.rolap.star.disableLocalSegmentCache=true

##Memory monitoring
#If enabled and one is using Java5 or above, then Mondrian will use the Java5 memory monitoring capability - a MemoryLimitExceededException exception ought be throw rather than a OutOfMemoryError when memory get low and the JVM will not crash.
mondrian.util.memoryMonitor.enable=false

##SQL generation
#If enabled, some NON EMPTY CrossJoin MDX statements will be computed in the database and not within Mondrian/Java
mondrian.native.crossjoin.enable=true
#Max number of constraints in a single `IN' SQL clause.
mondrian.rolap.maxConstraints=1000
#Currently grouping sets will be used only against Oracle, DB2 and Teradata.
mondrian.rolap.groupingsets.enable=true

##Miscellaneous
#Maximum number of simultaneous queries the system will allow.
mondrian.query.limit=100
#If set to true, during schema load, invalid members are ignored and will be treated as a null member if they are later referenced in a query.
mondrian.rolap.ignoreInvalidMembers=true
#absolute - The SOLVE_ORDER value is absolute regardless of where it is defined; e.g. a query defined calculated member with a SOLVE_ORDER of 1 always takes precedence over a cube defined value of 2.
#scoped - Cube calculated members are resolved before any session scope calculated members, and session scope members are resolved before any query defined calculation. The SOLVE_ORDER value only applies within the scope in which it was defined.
mondrian.rolap.SolveOrderMode=scoped
#Defines how a null Member is represented in the result output. MSAS 2000 shows empty value while MSAS 2005 shows "(null)"
